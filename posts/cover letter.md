Nivando Soares da Silva

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Nivando Soares and I am a self-taught software developer with experience working as a freelancer. During my career, I have had the opportunity to work on some projects, such as making small visual changes to an existing website built with WordPress for a company, and creating a website for a local company that deals with real estate documentation in my city.

I am skilled in **FrontEnd** development and responsive web design, with knowledge in using tools such as **CSS, Node JS, GIT, MySQL** and **Linux**. I actively study and strive to apply my knowledge in my projects. I am able to work with code versioning systems and have knowledge in databases and server administration. Additionally, I am a dedicated learner and always seek to learn new skills and technologies. I have projects in my [portfolio](https://nivando.dev/) that demonstrate my knowledge in the skills mentioned.

I am very interested in working for a company like yours that values innovation and creativity
