# Simplifying and Enhancing: The Journey of Rewriting My Personal Website in Markdown

## Introduction:

As a full-stack developer, my passion has always been in backend logic and application development. I must admit that my knowledge in user interface design and CSS development is limited. However, recognizing the importance of accessibility and performance in a website, I decided to embark on a journey of rewriting my old personal website (nivandosoares.com.br) into a text-focused version using Markdown. I would like to share with you the advantages of this approach and how it can improve website accessibility and performance.

## Accessibility: Embracing Simplicity

By rewriting my website in Markdown, I noticed a significant improvement in terms of accessibility. With a focus on text and a well-defined semantic structure, I made my content more accessible to all users, including those who use screen readers. Markdown, being a minimalist format, allows me to focus on the quality of content without worrying about complicated design details.

Using Markdown, I can structure my content with appropriate headings, numbered or bulleted lists, and even emphasize words with bold or italic formatting. This clear and semantic structure facilitates content comprehension for all users, regardless of their visual or cognitive abilities.

## Performance: Lightweight and Speedy

Another notable advantage of rewriting my website in Markdown was the improvement in performance. As mentioned earlier, my knowledge in CSS and UX design was limited, which resulted in performance optimization challenges on my old website. Heavy images, complex scripts, and elaborate styles negatively impacted the site's loading speed.

By adopting Markdown, I experienced the benefits of lightweight and speedy performance. Markdown is a simple and lightweight text format, eliminating the need for complex CSS and JavaScript files for styling and interactivity. This resulted in lighter and faster-loading pages. Additionally, with a minimalist and text-focused design, I reduced the amount of visual content and additional resources, contributing to a smoother and more responsive browsing experience.

## Focus on What Matters: Content

One of the reasons I chose to rewrite my website in Markdown was to focus on what truly matters: the content. As a full-stack developer with expertise in application development and backend logic, creating a highly stylized and complex website was not my area of expertise.

With Markdown, I can dedicate my time and effort to writing articles, tutorials, and sharing my knowledge without being overly concerned about design and styling details. The simplicity and clarity of Markdown allow my content to shine and be the star of my website.

## Conclusion

By rewriting my old personal website in Markdown for a text-focused version, I was able to experience several significant advantages. Enhanced accessibility, improved performance, and the ability to focus on content were the key benefits I gained from this change. While my expertise in design and CSS may be limited, Markdown allowed me to create a more accessible, faster, and content-centric website.

So, if you're a developer who resonates with this situation and is looking for a simplified approach for your personal website, consider giving Markdown a chance. You'll be amazed by the clarity, accessibility, and performance it can bring to your project. After all, we all have different skills and talents, and it's important to find the approach that best suits our needs. Now, excuse me, I need to continue studying backend technologies and leave design and CSS to the experts!
